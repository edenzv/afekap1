					As one of the largest and most diverse countries in the world, The United States boast an amazing amount of tourist destinations ranging from the skyscrapers of New York and Chicago, the natural wonders of Yellowstone and Alaska to the sunny beaches of California, Florida and Hawaii. With so many tourist attractions in the USA it's tempting to list entire cities or even states, but in this top 25 I have tried to focus on specific attractions.

					<h2>Times Square</h2>
					<p>
					Times Square (nicknamed "The Crossroads of the World") is the best known square in New York City and also its beating heart. It got its name in 1904 and it was named after the New York Times which moved the headquarters there. 

It comes into focus mainly during the New Year's Eve celebrations which are traditionally held at Times Square (the tradition dating back to 1903) and covered by the ABC programme: Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. 

The highlight of the evening is the famous ball dropping during which the huge ball descents about half a meter.

					<p>
					The tradition of counting down the last seconds of the year while watching the huge ball slowly go down dates back to 1907. The moment it drops completely, the New Year starts.

Times Square is also known for its neon signs. The NASDAQ sign at Times Square is the world's largest LED sign. Also, there are many brand shops, cafes and restaurants. The square also appeared in many films. Among the most famous ones are Vanilla Sky, Enchanted, Spider-Man 3 or New Year's Eve.

Times Square is usually crowded with tourists. Note that since 2011, the square is smoke free.

					<h2><br/>Central Park</h2>
					<p>
					entral Park is the largest park in New York City. Spreading across 843 acres, the park is even bigger than some countries (e.g. the Principality Monaco or the Vatican City State). Despite the fact that it was landscaped, it looks very natural. The park was opened for public for the first time in 1858 and broadened to its present-day size in 1873.

					<p>
					Central Park is one of the most popular filming locations in New York City. Among many films that feature the Central park is Breakfast at Tiffany's, When Harry Met Sally or Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. 
					Among the many places worth visiting in Central Park are: the Belvedere Castle, the famous Strawberry Fields (a memorial dedicated to John Lennon) and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. If you do not feel like walking all the way through the park, you can rent a bike, enjoy a horse carriage tour or a pedicab tour.
